# Flappy-Clone-JS
## Flappy Bird clone using HTML Canvas

<p>This is a mini game made during my studies of JavaScript and Web Technologies. Don't expect it to be polished or optmized.</p>
<p>This is the second version of the game, reworked to use the HTML Canvas.</p>

### How to Play
<p>Press any key to start the game. Pressing a key will make the bird flap up. Avoid the pipes and try to get the highest score!</p>

### Planned Improvments
- Settings adjustment
- Background decorations (clouds?)
- Increasing game speed
