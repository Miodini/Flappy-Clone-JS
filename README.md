# Flappy-Clone-JS
## Flappy Bird clone made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<p>This is a mini game made during my studies of JavaScript and Web Technologies. Don't expect it to be polished or optmized.</p>
<p>I purposely decided not to use the canvas tag nor any framework in order to exercise the use of more "traditional" web design tools, as at the time this text was typed, I was still learning.</p>

### How to Play
<p>Press and hold any key to start the game. Holding a key will make the bird go up, releasing it will make the bird go down. Avoid the pipes and try to get the highest score!</p>

### Known Bugs
- Modifying the xPipeDist makes some pipes appear either too close or too far from the previous one
- Pipes won't leave the screen properly when setting decimal values to xSpeed

### Planned Improvments
- More consistent hitbox
- Working settings button (settings can only be changed via code right now)
- Background decorations(clouds?)
- Increasing game speed
