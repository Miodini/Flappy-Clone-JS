# Flappy-Clone-JS
## Flappy Bird clone made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

<p>This is a mini game made during my studies of JavaScript and Web Technologies. Don't expect it to be polished or optmized.</p>
<p>I purposely decided not to use the canvas tag nor any framework in order to exercise the use of more "traditional" web design tools, as at the time this text was typed, I was still learning.</p>

### How to Play
<p>Press and hold any key to start the game. Holding a key will make the bird go up, releasing it will make the bird go down. Avoid the pipes and try to get the highest score!</p>

### Planned Improvments
- An actual restart button
- More consistent hitbox
- Background decorations(clouds?)
- Changing some hardcoded settings to variables
- Increasing game speed
